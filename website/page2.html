Throughout the course I have read about and heard in videos how things have changed <br>
in Russia since the Soviet Union dissolved. I would like to compare the changes that<br>  
the government made with the Russian people’s perspective of those changes.<br> 
The experiences and viewpoints from the characters in My Perestroika and Brother,<br> 
along with the stories of Masha and Katya give insight to what it means to be Russian.<br> 
In each case, the individuals reflect on the changes they have witnessed, but also<br> 
give us the impression that things haven’t changed as much after all. This is also<br> 
mirrored in the people’s view of Putin today, in contrast to when he was first elected.<br>

Factorio is a game in which you build and maintain factories. You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies.

In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire.
